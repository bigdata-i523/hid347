    abstract: Qualitative research has been and continues to be an important research approach in the social sciences.  Some of the most important qualitative approaches are ethnography, surveys, and textual analysis, with data coding being a fundamental analytic process.  Sociology has used qualitative research to describe interactions between individuals (the micro-level), community and institutional-level dynamics (the meso-level), and structures and processes of entire societies (the macro-level).  Big data may have the unique potential to allow researchers to look at all three of these layers together in combination, in ways that have not been possible before. Similarly, big data has been used to combine qualitative and quantitative research in novel ways.  Uniquely, big data gives researchers the ability to get large amounts of real-time and ongoing data about human behavior as it exists in actual social situations, unfiltered by the somewhat artificial instruments designed by researchers.
