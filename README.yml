        Qualitative research has been and continues to be an important research approach in the social sciences.  Some of the most important qualitative approaches are ethnography, surveys, and textual analysis, with data coding being a fundamental analytic process.  Sociology has used qualitative research to describe interactions between individuals (the micro-level), community and institutional-level dynamics (the meso-level), and structures and processes of entire societies (the macro-level).  Big data may have the unique potential to allow researchers to look at all three of these layers together in combination, in ways that have not been possible before. Similarly, big data has been used to combine qualitative and quantitative research in novel ways.  Uniquely, big data gives researchers the ability to get large amounts of real-time and ongoing data about human behavior as it exists in actual social situations, unfiltered by the somewhat artificial instruments designed by researchers.

    title: Mapping Police Killing of Citizens in the United States
    abstract: >
        With the rise of camera phones that allows citizens to videotape law enforcement brutality against citizens, and the ability to immediately make those videos public through social media, there has been an increased awareness of police killings of citizens, and a number of systematic attempts to document these events, since there is no government database that has been shown to be credible on this issue. These events can be mapped at the county level (3,143 counties in the US are listed in the 2015 Census Tiger Shapefiles) with the open source software QGIS.  Further, demographic and economic data gathered by the Census at the county level (5-year estimates as of 2015 with the American Community Survey) can be collected and tested against the police-killings data to determine if a regression model can be used to describe a significant pattern among these variables.
