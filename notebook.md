# Practice

* 9/2 Installed Virtualbox, Ubuntu & Python 2 & 3 via pyenv
* 9/9 Bought Raspberry Pi and required accessories.  Installed NOOBS
* 9/19-9/23 Started learning how to use Linux.  
* 10/20 Started learning Python.  Used Ubuntu installed on Virtualbox on Windows 10
* 11/4-11/5 Searched for and found data for final project
* 11/6-11/7 Cleaned the data to be used for final project.  Required manually looking up 60 different homicide victim's place of death
* 11/9 Discovered Paper 2 did not compile.  Had to upload several files to Github account.  Professor also placed some files
* 11/9 Placed several technical files on Github account for the final project so that it would compile--copied from Paper 2 files
* 11/10-11/11 Learned new regression model for final project.  Had not previously done work with 'count' data or 'mass at zero' data
* 11/12-11/15 Worked on regression analysis model & regression diagnostics using RStudio
* 11/12-11/16 Collected and read resources on 'count' data analysis
* 11/16-11/17 Had to start regression analysis from the beginning. Had assumed I needed to use "zero-inflated negative binomial" model, however, realized this was theoretically unsound.  Switched to simple negative binomial in GLM
* 11/16 Worked in QGIS to create mapping of homicides
* 11/17 Coded R-script to automatically perform all of the statistical analyses for the final project
* 11/18 Uploaded Final Project R-script to Github as RScript, data as data1.csv, variables as variables, and list of original data that had to be cleaned as baddata 
* 11/19 Working in Ubuntu using Virtualbox was incredibly frustrating.  Installed Python 2.7 and 3.6 directly onto Windows, learned how to use Powershell to access Python
* 11/20 Learned how to use PYQGIS--Python console in QGIS
* 11/20 Coded Python script to automatically create the QGIS map for the final project
* 11/20 Learned how to use Box at IU.  Shapefile was too big to upload to Github, so shapefile and dbf file were zipped and uploaded to Box
* 11/21 Uploaded Python script to Github as QGISScriptKilledByPolice.py
* 11/24 Submitted my first experiment, visualizing class data ("Classification 2"), and loaded to Github as R-Script

* 9/10 Had Paper 1 topic approved.  Began researching appropriate journal articles, have found 10 that seem relevant & useful
* 10/5 Learned how to use Jabref
* 10/4-10/6 Gathered more articles for Paper 1
* 10/5-10/7 Wrote Paper 1
* 10/8 Submitted Paper 1 to Github
* 10/11 Submitted a review of HID311's Paper 1 to Piazza for discussion assignment
* 10/20 Fixed noted issues with Paper 1

* 10/24-26  Explored Final Project topic 
* 10/25-26  Gathered resources for Paper 2 
* 10/26 Had Paper 2 topic approved
* 10/27 Had Final Project topic approved
* 10/27-11/1 Gathered resources Final Project 
* 10/27-11/4 Gathered resources for Paper 2
* 11/1-11/4 Wrote Paper 2 on Sharelatex
* 11/5 Submitted Paper 2 to Github
* 11/6-11/16 Gathered literature review for Final Project  
* 11/17-11/22 Wrote the final paper on Sharelatex
* 11/24 Finished final draft of Final Project and submitted to Github.  Set status=99% on yaml file
* 11/28-29 Made final changes to Final Project and set status=100% to yaml file
